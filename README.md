# Game-Tournament

Project overview:
Our project focuses on creating a management system for a company that organizes game tournaments. These tournaments include board games, card games, and online (video) games.
The system manages:
-Tournament details: name, location, start and end dates, and rewards.
-Players: each participant registers with their surname, name, pseudonym, age, and gender.
-Matches: scheduled in advance, including match date, table number, game type (board, card, or online), maximum play time, and number of referees.
-Games: each game includes its name, type, editor, release date, and age requirement.
For a tournament to take place, a minimum of two players is required.

Why this project?
We wanted to choose a topic connected to our daily lives and interests. In our friend group, we often play Belote, and things can get quite competitive!
From there, we had the idea of combining our passion for games and competition, leading us to design a tournament management system.
While Belote was our starting point, we realized we also enjoy many other types of games, card games, board games, and online games, so we decided to include them all in our project.

Key Feature:
-Tournament creation and management
-Player registration and tracking
-Match scheduling and referee assignment
-Game database with detailed attributes
-Validation of tournament requirements (minimum two players)
